A chess engine which uses entropy (# of possible moves) as its static evaluation function — could test partly using 1-D chess program

Homo Deus: “Evolutionary humanism ... insists that ... some humans are simply superior to others” (254) “Not all evolutionary humanists are racists” (258) 
Wtf?

Possible biological reason for consciousness: because we have minds, and we think people like us have minds, we ensure survival of our genes because we wouldn’t want someone else to go through pain?

Non-biased linear classification: score based classification, but you don’t want the system to internally classify a variable v that is given (for instance, is a woman). First, develop a linear classifier for v. If there is no correlation between the linear classifier for v and the classifier you’re looking for, then the dot product of the score formulas must be zero. Add this extra constraint and minimize the resulting Lagrangian using gradient descent.

Certificate of American Patriotism: a voluntary tax/donation to the government that people can pay for to get a government issued certificate. Different levels for how much you pay. Above certain amounts, can be embroidered with precious metals to be extra attractive to rich people. A way for the government to make revenue from people who don’t like paying taxes to pay off debt or for other uses. Unlike a bond, the government doesn’t actually have to pay the buyer back, so actually makes money. Unlike a Maltese passport, doesn’t provide any special privileges, so corrupt tycoons can buy them without harm.

A poem written to the same rhythm/time as an instrumental song—could be complex, like 2112 Overture

Data Diversification: given a data set, extrapolating data points in areas of low data density to create new data points. Could be used in facial recognition to diversify testing data so that given a data set of pictures with more white people, could create more pictures of people of color so that the facial recognition system recognizes people of color just as well as whites.

Resilience Augmentation: for a convolutional neural net made to classify pictures, look at pictures in training data and modify by changing as few pixels as possible until the neural net identifies it as an incorrect category. If the altered image is similar enough to the original image (for instance, pixels changed below a certain threshold), put altered image in testing data under same category as original image. Should be able to train the neural net to be more resilient because it can now classify correctly slightly altered images which look the same to humans and possibly make the neural net “see” more like a human.

Cyclic Gryphon Chess piece value calculations based on piece value in future and using infinite series
- Might want to use a local value of 4 instead of 3 for bishop bc no longer color-bound 

Gatesourcing: Analyzing many-dimensional data by having a large number of human workers look at graphs of two random variables and drawing “gates” around the categories and then using these gates as classifiers and using boosting to construct a better classifier. 

WhatTheyKnow: a possible website using cookies to tell the user what it suspects their race, gender, chance of getting depression, etc. are to raise awareness about what machine learning algorithms can figure out about people 

Selfbot: a chatbot designed to imitate a specific person; would require large amount of data about what a particular person said, but auto generated public social media posts or replies (for which there might be a lot of data by a particular person) may be possible without intrusion into the person’s private life 
- Could be used to “talk to” dead loved ones, yourself or others at different ages, allow you to see your inner flaws, etc.
- Unfortunately, many potential malicious uses
- Worldview Architecture: A human-like agent has a set of beliefs and principles that it learns from experience and applies to its choices. Could be useful model for selfbots.

Have a chatbot play interactive fiction with lots of dialogue, like Façade—might be particularly funny with a dawn age chatbot like ELIZA or PARRY

Close but no cigar cost (CBNCC) : where C is cost function, CBNCC = (C - k)^2, where k is a small constant. Can be used in machine imagination to produce more creative results. For instance, an ANN can be trained to recognize songs. To imagine, randomize a node layer in middle of network and then use gradient descent w/ CBNCC to get featured which aren’t exactly “right”. Then, randomize and find input nodes using gradient descent on standard cost.

Bayesian PDF: probability density function for a stochastic quantity you don’t know given its behavior in the past
- Ex: Suppose we have a coin and that we have no idea what probability it flips heads is. Initially, then, we have a uniform PDF on interval [0,1] for its probability of flipping heads.
- Suppose we flip the coin and it turns up heads. We can find the cumulative density function by defining an event A: coin has probability of flipping heads < x as a function of x and an event B: coin flipped up heads.
- To calculate the CDF, we do P(A|B) = P(A,B)/P(B). After another coin flip, we can recalculate CDF based on CDF from last time. To get the PDF we can just take derivative of CDF.

Higher Dimensional Go, or Go on cylindrical, spherical, torus boards

Using model merging to analyze a ton of chess games and figure out tactics and strategy of chess—a program that truly “understands” chess

Research Project: to get WT sequence into plasmid, have to ligate in — don’t generate at end

“Heavenly Language”: a Computer Science language even higher level than Java or Python, has “abstract methods” which work for any class in interest (such as different types of search, sort, etc). Could be useful for making a program which can write programs, because once the general algorithm and representation is in place, the abstract methods can do the rest of the work.
 
“Tag Team”: looks at many already played chess games and uses boosting of three or more different chess engines to make a classifier of whether a game is won, lost, or drawn (makes one classifier to determine won vs. not won, another to determine drawn vs. lost). In game play, looks at all possible moves and uses its classifier to determine which one to choose. Probably best if it uses several fundamentally different chess engines, like Stockfish, Komodo, and AlphaZero. If there is a way to boost evaluation functions instead of just classifiers, might want to use that instead (for instance, could use dimensionality reduction with gradient descent).
- Alternative: Given the board, uses as ANN trained by reinforcement learning (playing against itself) or some other method to determine which chess engine to use. In this case, only 1 chess engine would have to look ahead, instead of all of them, reducing computation. 

“AlphaDefence”: AlphaZero, except when training it, a draw is treated as a win. Might have to train against AlphaZero or another chess engine instead of itself. Could play with AlphaZero many times to see if chess is a “drawn game”.
- “AlphaAttack”: trained such that a draw is a loss—might play very aggressively

ExperiChess: software to make your own chess engine easily and experiment with algorithm and evaluation function 

Stochastic Chess: When making a move, players choose favorite 2 moves. Coin flip decides which is used. Could be used to explore interesting variations or to “spice up” computer chess. Could be expanded to n moves instead of 2 moves.

“Human”: a program which uses symbolic AI to interpret stories about strategy games, like chess, to play them. Such a program might play more like a human, hence its name.
- Could use studies from Lichess.com as data

Deep Boost—boosting boost functions
- RecBoost: each generation, add the previous generation boost to list of classifiers

An artificial life program specifically dedicated to communication—this might lead to “truly intelligent” artificial creatures

Artificial Philosophy: an AI which can, having seen the opinions of others and having experiences, interpret the world on its own, have its own opinions, and defend them would be pretty intelligent 
- Everything AI Philosophy: Everyone, on the most fundamental level, is controlled by physical laws. Thus, free will is in a sense an illusion; people are technically computers; there is no such thing as “artificial intelligence” because all intelligence is computed. What people claim is “AI” is something that appears to do intelligent things but cannot be understand very well (for instance, it is hard to understand ANNs at a fundamental level bc doing so requires imagination of hundreds or thousands of dimensions and calculations).
- The “Hello World” program for Everything AI: print(“I think, therefore I am.”) This program suggests that it is easy to mimic concepts of individuality and self, so much so that it is impossible to distinguish between “artificial intelligence” and “actual intelligence”.

New Type of supervised learning: luminescence learning 
- Each point in training data outputs a luminescence which degrades with distance from the point
- To classify a point in data to be classified, calculate sum of luminescence of all points for each category and pick highest (or use probabilities)
- Luminescence function has constants in it. Use gradient descent or genetic algorithms on these constants to maximize classification accuracy 
- Not very computationally heavy, more efficient compared to k-nearest neighbors (when classifying a point, does not have to sort distances of all points, just adds up function values)

Studying convergence to Nash equilibria after looking n moves ahead from random decisions 
- Also, continuous mixed Nash Equilibria (PDF) 

“Smart”: a movie where all the smart devices in someone’s house start talking to each other after the inhabitants leave, having learned how to talk through countless conversations they overheard 

“Hapsburgs”: chess variant played by several (6–12?) people who are randomly distributed pieces from both sides. The people with king from each side alternate moves. Each piece starts out with a certain amount of money. On each turn, the king makes deals with pieces to get them to move. King has power to give or take away money from any piece in their command. Instead of moving to the ordered square, pieces can “revolt”, becoming their own king. In between turns, pieces on neighboring squares can make side deals. Captured pieces can go to the “prison” of the side which captured the piece, and can be exchanged or be allowed to switch sides and serve the opposite king. When king captured, goes to prison, pieces on king-less side can choose to be their own king or not; then remaining pieces decide which side to join. Game ends when one sovereign king remains, and players try to get maximum amount of money.

A program which could “compile” pseudocode into actual code, “compile” ideas into pseudocode, and imagine problem ideas would be extremely powerful 

It is possible that “Planet Nine” is a small black hole. If small black holes are common in the universe, what would they look like when passing in front of their parent stars? Have we found anything like this in existing transit data?
- Ask Neil deGrasse Tyson

1-D Chess: could be very easy to program an implementation for two players. Could also potentially implement a Minimax algorithm to play against the computer.
- Could also do something like this for Connect 4, Tic Tack Toe, or Sticks

“QuantumFish”: Like Stockfish, but uses qubits to carry out multiple calculations at once, making it a “Super-Bulldozer” intelligence which can see many moves beyond Stockfish and potentially beat AlphaZero

“Markov Song”: A song which is a string of riffs which only make sense locally; in other words, like a Markov chain, each riff only depends on the riff immediately before it—there are no large repeating structures in the song.
- Some riffs may be repeated one or more times to sound aesthetically pleasing, but repetition of strings of riffs is rare, or non-existent.
- Appears a lot in prog. Examples: “2112: Overture” by Rush, “Fly From Here: Overture” by Yes, “Magnum Opus” by Kansas, “Duke’s Travels/Duke’s End” by Genesis 
- Could be used by AI to make “creative” or “prog-like” songs

“The Turing Test”: reality TV show where people are “matched” up to people they find attractive through their profile picture and communicate via text thereafter. However, there is a certain chance that the picture is actually computer generated and that the “person” they are talking to is a chat bot—have to try to figure out whether it’s a real person or not 

Short Story: “Bonus Points”: about a girl on Mars who is majoring in music who writes a program to write a song to get bonus points to boost her failing grade. Along the way, she has to threaten a talk-bot with a computer virus to get her access to ANNE, an AI which she needs to help her write the program.

Phylogenetic Machine Learning (Unsupervised)
- Starting out with a bunch of different points, find the two nearest points 
- Group these two points into a “common ancestor” point with the two points as descendants and its value being the average of the other two
- Remove descendants from list, but group them as variables of the common ancestor to keep track of later
- Keep doing this until only one point is left
- Display using a tree or color hues showing which points are most “related” to each other or by drawing circles around each group 

A “story” consisting of fictional “primary sources”, like notes in a class, programs, texts, etc. that tell a story.
- Could be used for “Bad Recursion BRB”

Way to do “surface volume”: sum up (triple integral) differential parallelepipeds using magnitude of triple scalar product

Operator Functions: Express functions of operators (like derivatives) as their Taylor series—for instance, e^D(f) = f + Df + D^2(f)/2 + D^3(f)/6 + ...
- Metaderivative: The derivative function of the function itself!
- Denoted by M
- Ex: M(x^2) = D^2(x^2) = D(2x) = 2
- Is there a non-trivial function which is its own Metaderivative?

Short Story: “Evolutionary Programming”
- Set about 50 years from now, when China and the US are in a Cold War in which the “atomic bombs” are actually computer viruses threatening to destroy the other country 
- The US has a top secret project to use a quantum supercomputer to produce general AI through evolutionary programming. The general AI, once trained enough, may hopefully be able to write programs to defend against China computer viruses, hack China computers, or mine data to spy on the Chinese.
- The protagonist is an operator of the quantum supercomputer. At the start of the story, she has gotten to computer to what she believes is a false minimum. She starts looking at the different programs in more detail and notices a very odd AI which is getting test scores far below the average. She examines it more closely and finds that it is one of the most intelligent AI ever produced.

Fractal Song: Each note becomes its corresponding chord. Repeat several iterations.

Using “evolution” to create programs 
- Each line of code is either jumping forward or backward by a certain amount or the input value into the program 
- Each program ends when it jumps outside the domain of the code or it reaches a line it was already at and returns the number of lines it jumped to in the process 
- Create a large number (100,1000) random programs and see which ones are closest to the values supposed to be outputted (lowest sum of squares of differences values)
- For these close programs, save them for the next generation and then “mutate” copies of them and add to the next generation. Mutations can be substitutions (change one line of code to another), insertions (adding a line of code somewhere) or deletions (deleting a line of code). 
- Do this many, many times until a successful program results. Functions you can test are f(x) = x, f(x) = x^2, etc.

Semi-tangent lines: intersect with a curve exactly once
- Not all semi-tangent lines are tangent, not all tangent lines are semi-tangent

Make interpreter/compiler for assembly pseudocode

Random functions: functions of a real number which output a random variable 
- Ex: A function which models the number of times lighting has struck in an area, or how many particles of a radioactive material have decayed, distribution of an allele in a population over time
- Model how well a population survives when there are random catastrophes of various magnitudes (like fires, droughts, etc.)
- How to do? Diff Eq with Laplace Transform—do it as a probability weight function, and do it in terms of each possible value OR do it as a linear DE

Is e^ln|z| = |z| for complex numbers? (Note that if z = a + bi, |z| = sqrt(a^2+b^2), while ln|z| is the power series (z-1)-(z-1)^2/2+... ) Matrices?

DELA textbook talks about exponential matrices: e^A = I + A + A^2/2! + ... + A^n/n!
Could you use this to find sin, cos, log, tan-1, etc. of matrices? Can you do the Laplace Transform of a matrix? What if we extended the Mandelbrot set to matrices? Matrices to the power of matrices (or absolute values of them)?

A multivariable function to help evaluate integrals by partial derivatives inside the integrand: 



An interpreted programming language with no functions, classes, etc. or even arrays, but contains “jumps”, “labels”, inserts” and deletes”. A jump command jumps to the line of code specified, or a label if specified; the insert and delete operations insert and delete code at the specified line or label. Structures such as arrays, functions, and classes can be built from the bottom up. Additionally, certain operations within the code can reference code itself, leading to programs which alter themselves chaotically. Could write the language to be “interpreted” via Python.
- Alternatively, a language where there are no variables, just functions, but variables can be built from functions into complex structures and alter each other.

Random E1 Demon/Devil Generator

Theory of BSTs: how well Binary Search Trees cope with data from different distributions (like uniform, normal, log-normal, exponential, etc.)

Unsupervised Machine Learning 
- K-Means: Start out with n groups. Randomly pick n points and call them centroids. For each other point, put it in a group with the closest centroid. Then, recalculate the centroids based on the average of all points in the group, and reassign points to the closest centroid. Repeat many times.

Machine learning algorithm: creating a total score using a linear combination and then analyze distributions of scores for different categories to assign probabilities to predict categories 
- Since I don’t know gradient descent, could use evolutionary methods 
- Could have one value for each descendant that keeps track of where it is and another of its mutation amount. The mutation amount itself can mutate on a log scale so that the objects can get closer and closer to the target value without jumping too far away.
- Approximation to gradient descent/ascent: pick points near and use secant plane approximation of gradient 
- K-nearest neighbors: look at k nearest numbers and whichever group has most is the group it’s in; find most accurate k
- Possible uses: astronomical data (predict whether a planet is terrestrial  or gas) 

A superhero: can assume any possible human form because they are in quantum superposition from their mother committing quantum suicide. Their arch-enemy is their twin brother, who can be in multiple places at once and “tunnel” through walls and other solid surfaces.

A machine learning chess program that isn’t given the rules of chess but deduces them by looking at millions of games played by humans—might play more like a human than chess programs that play against themselves like AlphaZero

A movie idea (Mrs. Thrash’s idea): about after human civilization has essentially collapsed. One person is left in the whole film, there is no dialogue, just the sounds of the wind and of the main character going through the trash to find stuff.

“Bad Recursion BRB”: short story set in dystopian future where America refused to deal with the same problems it’s dealing with now, and pays for it. Main character is a rich teenage girl whose family is about to marry off to a rich teenage boy, and though she foresees the problems that will result, she refuses to stand up for herself. She is a programmer, and at the end of the story she makes a program that results in an infinite loop (or possibly infinite recursion).

Could machine learning be used to predict the stock market?

Could you make an AI that “lives” on the internet and learns from posts and websites?
- Evolutionary Programs: Programs written in LISP or some other programs that “reproduce” on the internet or in an environment 
- Each time the programs “reproduce”, the new programs may have “mutations” in their code
- The programs attempt to change each other’s code to attack and destroy one another 
- The fittest programs survive, and thus evolution is occurring 

A type of series or product which is kinda like a Taylor Series, but instead of having the function’s derivative in each term, have its logarithmic derivative 

Create computer generated music in which the pitch varies by a differential equation (mimin)

“Bifurcations” with 2nd order constant coefficient linear DEs
- Find the solution for both of them in terms of the coefficients of the DE for a certain f(a), f’(a)
- When the limit as one of the coefficients approaches the bifurcation point is for one or both of the solutions (Depends on the situation), the solutions can equal each other 
- This can be used to define one of the solutions as a limit of the other
- Easier to do this with the Laplace Transform

Make a probability distribution program 

Craft n’ Crawl: Random Dungeon crawl game where you run around and collect items and craft them, kind of like Minecraft 
- Each room contains objects and/or monsters, generated randomly at the start of the game. The structure of the dungeon itself is a grid of a certain size to reduce complexity. The player can collect objects, craft them into other objects, and use them to fight monsters involved.
- To help the player know what’s going on, the player will be able to find and read scrolls that tell the player how to craft certain things, and the player will be able to “smell” and/or “hear” certain monsters within a certain distance. Additionally, there are chests throughout the dungeon that have objects and scrolls, and monsters drop objects when killed. Potions may allow players to be healed, become extra-powerful, or potentially sustain damage.
- Make a code for each command the user inputs and store it in a file. The program uses a while loop to go through list of commands to bring the player back to where they were last. 
- For commands which involve randomness, such as combat and wandering monsters, the code command will not be what the user inputs, but rather that and the value randomly produced in question, so the entire adventure can be preserved. Alternative: use a chaos function for all randomness and just record the random seed at the front.
- At each floor of the dungeon, there is a room with a trapdoor, leading down to the next floor. The goal of the game is to reach the lowest floor before dying (money and/or XP might be added on later). Each floor gets harder and harder, with more powerful and larger numbers of monsters. Similar to rogue-like games, each dungeon theoretically has infinitely many floors, but the player has only one life.

Finding shapes of sums and products of continuous random variables, probably using calculus and the binomial expansion 
- Finding distributions of mins and maxes of multiple random variables by interpreting probabilities as integrals (areas) and taking the derivative
- PDF of sum of two random variables, f(x) and g(x), is given by the following integral, whose bounds are the largest domain on which f(t)g(x-t) is defined: 


- This is because at any given point on the sum function, it’s height (infinitesimal probability) is given by the weighted average (integral) of the  products of the heights of f and g at points such that they equal x. Note the similarity to the convolution integral.
- Apparently this is right!


Proof of power rule recursively using product rule

Church-Turing hypothesis related to uncertainty and how a quantum computer may be necessary to properly simulate a human mind 
- Additionally, can a computer attain “creativity” if it only has a simulation of the cerebral cortex? Is it necessary for simulations or inner parts of the brain to do so?
- If computers cannot be “original” or “creative” because they are always created by something or someone else, can humans? After all, we are heavily influenced by our experiences with other people around us, and our own genotype was “created” by our parents
- Most AI created today is capable of learning, but is “told” how to learn. If AI was created which learned how to learn, would it be more powerful and/or more human?
